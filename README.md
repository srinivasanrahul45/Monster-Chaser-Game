# Monster Chaser Game
2D Game build on Unity following [Learn Unity - Beginner's Game Development Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB1F9G0JXOo&list=WL&index=5) YouTube tutorial and adding my own elements into the game.
## Game Objective:
You are left alone in an empty world filled with zombies and ghosts. And unfortunately you don't have any weapons with you, so you need to jump and avoid the monsters and survive as long as possible.
## My Elements in the game:
- Added Scoring mechanism
- Added Game Over Screen
- Added Game Pause feature
- Added Help Menu
- Added a Sound Track
